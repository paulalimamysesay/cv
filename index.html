<p><em>Founder and CEO of the <strong><a href="">EcoRise Sierra Leone</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Driven and ambitious individual with a passion for teaching, leadership, and community development. My experience includes captaining my university basketball team and serving as the Minister of Games and Sports, where I developed strong leadership, team management, and program coordination skills. As a volunteer with One Family Sierra Leone, WASH-NET Sierra Leone, and the Catholic Youth Organization, I have actively promoted youth engagement, education, and personal development within communities.  

I hold a BSc in Computer Science, with expertise in AI, multimedia, embedded systems, and graphic design. At Expert Computer Solutions, I gained hands-on experience in technical support, sales, and customer service, enhancing my problem-solving abilities and business acumen. With a long-term goal to run my own IT firm, I aim to use technology as a tool for empowerment and community development. I am excited to bring my skills in teaching, leadership, and technology to a dynamic team, contributing to projects that foster innovation and create sustainable impact in under served communities.
